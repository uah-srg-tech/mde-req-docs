            <text content="The Solar Orbiter mission has its origins in a proposal called &quot;Messenger&quot; that was submitted by Richter et al. in 1982 in response to an ESA call for mission ideas. At the meeting &quot;Crossroads for European Solar and Heliospheric Physics&quot; held in Tenerife in March 1998, the Heliophysics community recommended to: &quot;launch an ESA Solar Orbiter as ESA's next flexible mission, with possible international participation, for launch around 2007.&quot; The kick-off meeting for a preassessment study of the &quot;ESA Solar Orbiter&quot; concept was held at ESTEC on 25 March 1999."/>

            <text content="Solar Orbiter was subsequently proposed in 2000 by E. Marsch et al. and was selected by the Science Programme Committee (SPC) in October 2000 as a Flexi-mission for launch after BepiColombo, in the 2008- 2013 timeframe. A number of internal and industrial studies were then carried out, including parallel system level Assessment Studies performed in industry between April and December 2004. At its 107th meeting in June 2004 the SPC confirmed Solar Orbiter's place in the Horizon 2000+ programme with the goal of a launch in October 2013 and no later than May 2015."/>

            <text content="Work continued on the mission and payload definition throughout 2005 and 2006 and at its meeting in February 2007, SPC instructed the Executive to find ways to implement Solar Orbiter within a financial envelope of 300 M€ (at 2006 EC), while keeping a realistic contingency margin. In response to this request, a Joint Science and Technology Definition Team (JSTDT) comprising scientists and engineers appointed by ESA and NASA, studied the benefits to be gained by combining ESA's Solar Orbiter mission and NASA's Solar Sentinels into a joint programme."/>

In total, 14 proposals were received by ESA in response to the Payload AO."/>

            <text content="A major change in the progress of Solar Orbiter occurred in November 2008, when the SPC decided to integrate Solar Orbiter into the first planning cycle of Cosmic Vision 2015-25 as an M mission candidate for the first launch opportunity in 2017. In addition, in view of NASA's high prioritization of Solar Probe Plus (SPP) in its Living With a Star programme, and the strong science synergies between Solar Orbiter and SPP, ESA called for an independent review of the PRC's recommended payload, now in the context of a joint Solar Orbiter-SPP scientific programme. The joint ESA-NASA review panel confirmed the validity of the recommended payload in its report of March 2009. As a result, the instrument selections, as recommended by the PRC in 2008 were formally announced on 20 March 2009. In parallel, NASA announced the results of the FOSO selection, and selected 2 instruments and portions of 2 instruments to be included in the Solar Orbiter payload. A Design Status Review, being the final review of the industrial Phase B1 study conducted by Astrium Ltd. (UK) as Prime Contractor, was held in ESTEC in June 2009."/>

            <text content="At its 128th meeting on 17th &amp;amp; 18th February 2010, ESA's Science Programme Committee made a further programmatic change by endorsing a &quot;fast track&quot; approach for Solar Orbiter outlined in ESA/SPC(2010)3, rev. 1. This approach is based on the scientific viability of raising the minimum perihelion to 0.28 AU and on making maximum re-use of BepiColombo technologies and units. It calls for the start of a full spacecraft implementation (Phases B2/C/D) in early 2011, with mission confirmation by the SPC in Q2 2011."/>

Solar Orbiter must also relate these in-situ measurements back to their source regions and structures on the Sun through simultaneous, high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations both in and out of the ecliptic plane."/>
